 *   AGA - planar Intuition screen, 8 bitplanes in one contiguous Chip RAM
 *         block, every dirty rectangle pushed through Kalms' chunky-to-planar.
 *   EHB - planar Intuition screen in the chipset's Extra-Half-Brite mode: SIX
 *         bitplanes, so a quarter less Chip RAM and a quarter less c2p work
 *         than AGA, and it is a mode plain OCS/ECS machines have too. Colour
 *         registers 32..63 are fixed by the hardware at half the intensity of
 *         0..31, which is why the palette handed to amigagfx_set_ehb_palette()
 *         must already obey that rule. A different c2p is used here - see the
 *         contiguity note on amigagfx_blit.
 *   RTG - 8-bit CyberGraphX/Picasso96 screen. The chunky buffer IS the display
 *         format there, so the c2p disappears entirely and a blit becomes a
 *         per-row memcpy into the card's bitmap. No Chip RAM is used at all.
 *   WB  - NOT a screen at all: a normal, resizable, draggable Intuition WINDOW
 *         on the Workbench (default public) screen, sharing that screen's
 *         palette instead of owning one. The only backend where the game does
 *         not control the display mode, and therefore the only one that has to

 * and SILENTLY FALLS BACK to AGA if anything about it fails (no library, no
 * such mode, OpenScreen refused) - one log line says which and why, and the
 * game keeps running. amigagfx_backend() then reports AGA.
 *
 * backend AMIGAGFX_BACKEND_EHB asks for a 6-bitplane Extra-Half-Brite screen
 * and falls back the same way, to a normal 8-bitplane AGA screen, if the
 * chipset or Intuition will not give one. That fallback is harmless rather
 * than merely survivable: the caller has already reduced its sprites into the
 * 64-entry EHB index space, and those indices display correctly on an 8-plane
 * screen carrying the same 64 colours in registers 0..63. The player loses the
 * memory and speed win, not the picture.
 *
 * On AGA and EHB w must be a multiple of 32 (both c2p routines work in
 * 32-pixel columns); on RTG there is no such constraint and the caller must
 * not impose one.
 *
 * show_bar non-zero keeps the SYSTEM screen title bar visible (the real
 * Intuition bar with the depth gadget, so the player can flip to Workbench
 * like any other Amiga program). The bar takes vertical space: the drawable
 * game area is then w x amigagfx_game_height(), which is h minus the bar
 * height Intuition reports for the opened screen - it depends on the font
 * and the mode, so it is never hard-coded. With show_bar 0 the game area is
 * the full w x h, as before.
 *
 * backend AMIGAGFX_BACKEND_WB opens a resizable window on the Workbench screen
 * instead of a screen of our own, and w x h is then the INNER size asked for -
 * clamped to what the Workbench screen can hold. show_bar is meaningless there
 * (the window has its own title bar) and is ignored. It falls back to AGA like
 * the others, and the most likely reason it has to is that there is no public
 * screen at all: a game started from User-Startup runs BEFORE LoadWB, so there
 * is no Workbench to put a window on. The caller is expected to notice the
